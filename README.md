## TinyMCE Laravel Integration

Hello !Azul !Salam !  

This is the most easiest way to integrate the TinyMCE editor with Laravel  
You can copy/paste these codes into your project and try it out  
I'll be very happy if this helped you.  

Just make sur to add the exception of the uploading image route in the middlesware called **VerifyCsrfToken**  
And make sur to add the attribute **enctype="multipart/form-data"** in the form tag  
Any errors ? just leave a comment and i'll try to fixe it A.S.A.P
